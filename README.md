```

### üí≥ `dummy-payment-app/` - Test Payment Application

**Website**: https://github.com/saleor/dummy-payment-app

**Purpose**: A virtual payment application for testing Saleor payment and checkout functionality without configuring real payment providers.

**Main Functions**:

```

### üöÄ `start_saleor/` - Data Cleanup, Preparation and Application Startup Scripts

**Website**: https://github.com/wubin28/start_saleor

**Purpose**: Provides a complete set of scripts to demonstrate Saleor e-commerce functionality, including the full process of order placement through both GraphQL API and frontend interface.

**Main Scripts**:
- `s1_start_saleor_and_place_order_by_graphql.sh`: Start Saleor and place an order via GraphQL API
- `s2_to_s4_start_and_place_order_by_storefront.sh`: Start all services and place an order via frontend
- `s4_to_s1_stop.sh`: Stop all services

**Demo Process**:
1. **GraphQL API Order**: Directly call API to create an order, initialize shipping address
2. **Frontend Interface Order**: Complete purchase process through browser
3. **End-to-end Testing**: Automate testing of complete shopping flow with Playwright

**Usage Method**:
```bash
cd start_saleor/
# Step 1: GraphQL API Order
./s1_start_saleor_and_place_order_by_graphql.sh

# Step 2: Frontend Interface Order (must complete Step 1 first)
./s2_to_s4_start_and_place_order_by_storefront.sh

# Stop all services
./s4_to_s1_stop.sh
```

## Quick Start

**Important**: The steps below must be executed in order. Step 1 (GraphQL API) must be completed before proceeding to Step 2 (Storefront UI), as it initializes necessary data.

### 1. Place Order via GraphQL API

```bash
cd start_saleor

# Start Saleor and place an order using GraphQL API
./s1_start_saleor_and_place_order_by_graphql.sh

# You should see POST notifications in webhook.site
```

This script will:
- Start the Saleor service
- Create a test order using GraphQL API
- Initialize shipping address data for admin@example.com
- Send webhook notifications for order events

### 2. Place Order via Storefront UI 

**Note**: Make sure you have completed Step 1 before proceeding, as it sets up required shipping address data.

```bash
# Start all services and prepare for Storefront order
./s2_to_s4_start_and_place_order_by_storefront.sh

# Visit http://localhost:3000/ to access the Storefront
# Login with admin@example.com/admin
# Purchase the "monospace tee" product
# Shipping address should be auto-populated
```

Note: If you encounter a cookie error when accessing http://localhost:3000/, clear your Chrome browser cache.

You should see webhook POST notifications for the order events.

### 3. Run End-to-End Tests

After completing steps 1 and 2, you can run the end-to-end tests to verify the entire flow:

```bash
# Navigate to the E2E test directory
cd ../e2e_testing_for_saleor_happy_path

# Run the end-to-end tests using Playwright
npx playwright test tests/production-ready.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### 4. Stopping the Services

When you're done with testing, stop all services:

```bash
cd ../start_saleor
./s4_to_s1_stop.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Cookie Error
   - If you see a cookie error when accessing the Storefront, clear your Chrome browser cache
   - Then try accessing http://localhost:3000/ again

2. Service Startup
   - The scripts include waiting mechanisms to ensure services are properly started
   - If you encounter any service-related errors, ensure all Docker containers are stopped before retrying

3. Webhook Notifications
   - Webhook notifications can be monitored at webhook.site
   - Ensure you have internet connectivity to receive webhook notifications

## Default Credentials

- Admin Login:
  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: admin

## Additional Information

- The GraphQL Playground is available at: http://localhost:8000/graphql/
- The Storefront runs on: http://localhost:3000/
- Webhook notifications are sent to webhook.site for monitoring order events
